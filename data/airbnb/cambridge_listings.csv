This career path gave me the freedom to control my time and hence I was able to travel internationally at least a few times a year, I've been to over 15 countries across four continents, the pace's just too slow. I love staying at Airbnb to get local tips, make new friends, and as a way for me to enrich my global experience without physically traveling there, I want to become a host as well. Boston is a tourist destination for many reasons, and in Cambridge, I meet many intelligent, fun, and creative people all around the world. I hope to be a host and local guide for those who visiting Cambridge and Boston.

This career path gave me the freedom to control my time and hence I was able to travel internationally at least a few times a year, I've been to over 15 countries across four continents, the pace's just too slow. I love staying at Airbnb to get local tips, make new friends, and as a way for me to enrich my global experience without physically traveling there, I want to become a host as well. Boston is a tourist destination for many reasons, and in Cambridge, I meet many intelligent, fun, and creative people all around the world. I hope to be a host and local guide for those who visiting Cambridge and Boston.
